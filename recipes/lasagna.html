        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Going meatless doesn't mean giving up flavor with this layered lasagna, filled with vegetables and three kinds of cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce</li>
            <li>1 medium zucchini, shredded (1 cup)</li>
            <li>1 (12-oz.) container (1 1/2 cups) low-fat cottage cheese </li>
            <li>1 9-oz.) pkg. frozen spinach, thawed, squeezed to drain well</li>
            <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>8 oven-ready lasagna noodles (each about 7x3 inches)</li>
            <li>1 (4-oz.) can mushroom pieces and stems, drained</li>
            <li>8 oz. (2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spray 12x10-inch sheet of foil with nonstick cooking spray. In medium bowl, combine pasta sauce and zucchini; mix well. In another medium bowl, combine cottage cheese, spinach, Parmesan cheese and oregano; mix well. </li>
            <li>Spread 1/4 cup sauce mixture in ungreased 8-inch square (2-quart) glass baking dish. Top with 2 lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/2 cup sauce mixture over noodles. Drop 1/2 cup of spinach mixture by small spoonfuls over sauce mixture; spread carefully. Sprinkle with 1/4 of mushrooms and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese. </li>
            <li>Repeat layers 3 more times, beginning with noodles. Cover with foil, sprayed side down; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 400Â°F. Bake covered for 45 minutes. </li>
            <li>Uncover baking dish; bake an additional 10 minutes or until lasagna is bubbly around edges. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. </li>
        </ol>
