Practice for html

The current project is a culinary recipes page consisting of a main page
linking to 3 separate recipe pages. Each one has a descriptive title and
heading, an accompanying image to illustrate the expected final result,
a brief descriprion, a list of ingredients and a list of steps to
prepare the food.

When I finish this project I will have demonstrated my skills in writing html
code in the VSCode IDE and in using git for version control, as well
as github for storying my project's repository and its history of changes. As
for html specifically,I will have showed my ability to create organized
documents with its basic components and to use tags to add headings,
paragraphs, hyperlinks, images and ordered and unordered lists. I will also
have shown my ability to structure a basic webpage repository correctly.
Finally, I will have demonstrated my skills for writing good git commit
messages.
